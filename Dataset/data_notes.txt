This research has been conducted on YouTube videos to output an extractive summary.
This algorithmic summarization required the use of NLP libraries and other toolkits to work on videos as 
though they are stored locally.
Datasets that are likely to be related are segmented .json files and labeled video transcript .csv files. 
This approach was non-applicable to conventional labeled datasets. 

However, to test application efficacy, a number of videos have been sampled during the testing phase 
and had their performance evaluated
Finally, as an extension to this work, one can acquire a dataset of unlabeled video links with the following fields:

ID------YouTube URL------SUMMARY------APPROACH

where the summary and approach fields are to be filled as the user goes through the tests.
Despite this extension's likely success, data acquisition and preparation are not within scope of this paper.
